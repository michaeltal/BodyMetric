This repository hosts a simple Body Composition Tracker using Node.js.

Guidelines for contributions:

* Indentation for JavaScript, CSS, and HTML is two spaces.
* Always run `npm test` before committing code. The repo has no real tests but this ensures scripts run.
* After modifying the Node server or JavaScript files, run `node server.js` to confirm the server starts. You can stop it with Ctrl+C.
* Keep dependencies minimal and check in `package.json` for updates.
* Document new features in `README.md` where relevant.

Pull request messages should have **Summary** and **Testing** sections describing code changes and how you ran the tests.
