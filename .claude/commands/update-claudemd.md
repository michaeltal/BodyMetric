The goal is to update @CLAUDE.md to reflect the latest version of this project. First, read the file and check if it has a last update date at the end. If it does, check the git commit history so we what has been commited since the last update. Apart from that, scan the whole project, to see where @CLAUDE.md needs to be updated. For any update to the file, make sure to add Last update: [current date] at the end of the file. Think hard about what needs to be updated!
